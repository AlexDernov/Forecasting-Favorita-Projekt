- **2014–2016:** Oil price collapse (Ecuador's main export) led to budget deficits
- **April 2017:** Election of Lenín Moreno - Policy shifts, subsidy cuts, and public discontent

## 2. Economic Crises

### 2014–2016: Oil Price Crash

- Though Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar, import prices rose

### April 2016: 7.8-Magnitude Earthquake
- Mainly affected Manabí, but Guayas also suffered disruptions
- Infrastructure damage → higher construction material prices, supply chain issues

## Impact on Consumer Behavior

✔ **Lower incomes** (due to crisis & unemployment) → reduced spending on non-essential goods  
✔ **Price increases** (especially food & fuel) → shift to cheaper alternatives  
✔ **Demand shifts** - Post-earthquake surge in construction materials and basic goods  
✔ **Sales volatility** - Sharp declines during crisis months (April 2016, 2017)
